# Daemon Nanny
We are not entirely sure yet. It's a bit amorphous. Here are some possible, but probably wrong, top-level summaries:

- Helps you define (digital) environmental modifications, such as shutting down problem apps. This offloads the work of _"how long have I been doing X? because I think I decided for myself I only want to do X for 30 minutes everyday."_
- Maybe provides helpful hints

## Install
- Clone this repo
- Run this:
```sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

- You're done. Data capture will start immediately.

## Getting Started

Start living life! Come back the next morning and run some of these commands to get started with looking at the data:

```
TODO -- jq commands that work well
```

## Roadmap
- visualization primitives -- basically something like toggl, but for our _auto-generated_ data
