Notification -- oh is this productive or unproductive? for new tasks


# nightshift for linux, nightlight for macos

# Notifications in a nodejs context (cross-platform solution)

# cross-platform considerations:
- ubuntu's notify-osd sucks a lot, but there are other possibilities for more options
    > mostly, lacks link-travel-on-click functionality + reply functionality
- macos has reply + link-click, but it does not have dropdown (which is fine)
... this could be emulated with a linked-list sort of UI where you just "tab through" options until the right one is seen
