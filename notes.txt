- Personal Nanny Program (behavioral promoter)
    - want to go sleep at: 10pm
        - nightshift at 6pm, then 8pm even darker
            > vendored (non-system) cli dependency
            > nightlight
        - notification at 9:30pm to take melatonin & brush teeth
            > vendored (non-system) cli dependency
        - hard shutdown at 11pm (under some contingency of desktop activity)
            > simple shell command
        - set alarm for 7am
            > would be impossible since phones dont have api's
            > ... could maybe set an alarm from the computer on-shutdown
        - start russian roulette'ing at 10pm 
            > hard mode for cmd-api
        - shutdown youtube after 11pm
        - build a max for runeterra usage per day, shutdown the app (grabbing pid)
            > how does the app communicate the pid to the command???
            > or pkill

- we may be able to build a helper utility that simulates an ACTION spec in the cronenv
    - would need to pare-down $PATH & rebuild it
- npm run cleancron -- <copy-pasted-A-part-of-QPA>
- QPA-specs "cyupa"
- to prevent infinite shutdowns, could have safety mechanism of 10 minutes dont run on startup (easy to check startup time)
- could have cross-platform A rosetta stone
- for hard-limits, maybe we dont actually shutdown
- rewards for predefined positive behavior (nice pictures, or system notification messages which are a nice pat on the back, puts on some nice music)
- instead of shutdown, could do some funny fucky stuff like rotate display, invert colors
- could use SIP to firmware-lock cronjobs to get the best of both worlds (cant turn-off, but also, is really annoying. you would never prefer booting to firmware over just stopping the dopamine thing)

Notification -- oh is this productive or unproductive? for new tasks


# nightshift for linux, nightlight for macos

# Notifications in a nodejs context (cross-platform solution)
https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier
# cross-platform considerations:
- ubuntu's notify-osd sucks a lot, but there are other possibilities for more options
    > mostly, lacks link-travel-on-click functionality + reply functionality
- macos has reply + link-click, but it does not have dropdown (which is fine)
... this could be emulated with a linked-list sort of UI where you just "tab through" options until the right one is seen


- Feature: add in a snooze-rule
    > this would aim to ameliorate the problem of just turning off rules as one-off situational adjustments (but the problem is that "one-off" becomes a "off until it becomes a major problem again")
    > this is an alternative strategy when compared against default-reset-configuration-of-safety-mechanisms-at-EOD
    - no real ideas, but shitty idea: QPAC -- C for counter that gets auto-decremented (e.g. turn for 1 day, add a ;1 to the end of the statement)
    - alternative: add a [re]-"start" time, it's like the inverse of an expiry time
