- Personal Nanny Program (behavioral promoter)
    - want to go sleep at: 10pm
        - nightshift at 6pm, then 8pm even darker
            > vendored (non-system) cli dependency
            > nightlight
        - notification at 9:30pm to take melatonin & brush teeth
            > vendored (non-system) cli dependency
        - hard shutdown at 11pm (under some contingency of desktop activity)
            > simple shell command
        - set alarm for 7am
            > would be impossible since phones dont have api's
            > ... could maybe set an alarm from the computer on-shutdown
        - start russian roulette'ing at 10pm 
            > hard mode for cmd-api
        - shutdown youtube after 11pm
        - build a max for runeterra usage per day, shutdown the app (grabbing pid)
            > how does the app communicate the pid to the command???
            > or pkill
        - suggesting alternatives for any instantiations of undesired activities
            > we can chain this with annoying system notifications
            > do 3, on dismissal, you send another, and then another
            > "would you like to meditate?" 
            > todo list pop & suggest
- we may be able to build a helper utility that simulates an ACTION spec in the cronenv
    - would need to pare-down $PATH & rebuild it
- npm run cleancron -- <copy-pasted-A-part-of-QPA>
- QPA-specs "cyupa"
- to prevent infinite shutdowns, could have safety mechanism of 10 minutes dont run on startup (easy to check startup time)
- could have cross-platform A rosetta stone
- for hard-limits, maybe we dont actually shutdown
- rewards for predefined positive behavior (nice pictures, or system notification messages which are a nice pat on the back, puts on some nice music)
- instead of shutdown, could do some funny fucky stuff like rotate display, invert colors
- could use SIP to firmware-lock cronjobs to get the best of both worlds (cant turn-off, but also, is really annoying. you would never prefer booting to firmware over just stopping the dopamine thing)

- productivity signatures
vs
- un-productivity signatures
    - youtube
    - chess.com

Notification -- oh is this productive or unproductive? for new tasks

# Etc.
- blacklisted activity: time-sinks


# nightshift for linux, nightlight for macos
https://www.producthunt.com/posts/nightlight-3

# Notifications in a nodejs context (cross-platform solution)
https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier
# cross-platform considerations:
- ubuntu's notify-osd sucks a lot, but there are other possibilities for more options
    > mostly, lacks link-travel-on-click functionality + reply functionality
- macos has reply + link-click, but it does not have dropdown (which is fine)
... this could be emulated with a linked-list sort of UI where you just "tab through" options until the right one is seen


- Feature: add in a snooze-rule
    > this would aim to ameliorate the problem of just turning off rules as one-off situational adjustments (but the problem is that "one-off" becomes a "off until it becomes a major problem again")
    > this is an alternative strategy when compared against default-reset-configuration-of-safety-mechanisms-at-EOD
    - no real ideas, but shitty idea: QPAC -- C for counter that gets auto-decremented (e.g. turn for 1 day, add a ;1 to the end of the statement)
    - alternative: add a [re]-"start" time, it's like the inverse of an expiry time

Q;P;A;C;T;W
QPA;;SNOOZE-TIME;<interactive or always?>

- We will commit qpa-specs just as a fast early iteration nice thing to do, but the architecture will still be grabbing its configuration from a $HOME-dir dotfile. Maybe we stop committing these in the future but for now it will be nice to share.
    > what we will NOT be committing is the log file (which has a lot of personal info)


- chatdoug/chatdylan (chrome aliases) can be a great v0 for context-aware hooks
    > so, that entails bringing up an "open/curious items" notes page, associated with that person



- Easy context-dependent hooks -- distraction-prevention task-capture
```sh
nanny add-hook "chat" 'message so and so about blah and blah'
```
    - dylan says this brings in an additional type -- "the one time hook"
    > does it? possibly yea, but maybe it could be implemented in some special manner where you dont need to dynamically modify the QPA file, but instead, can have some other special file that gets appended to
    - could queue-up a bunch of things to watch when opening youtube non-productively

- Enumeration of behavioral modification style:
    - draconian -- e.g. shutdown the machine if you're being a dingus
    - nagging -- e.g. "hey dont do that, you know you shouldnt be doing that"
    - helpful -- e.g. "hey remember this thing you wanted to remember"
        - always want this, awesome!
    - suggestive/"helpful" -- e.g. "hey are you really sure you want to be doing this??? you could be eating your vegetables!"
        - a softer alternative, but similar circumstances, to draconian
    - rewarding -- e.g. "good job doing this thing I see you doing!"
        - e.g. on computer -- showing pictures you've pre-assigned as nice
    - friction/annoying -- e.g. every time you open a vm to play video games
        - on the computer this would be stuff like inverting colors, flip display, play annoying sounds

- IF (and this is unsatisfying due to "habit-Source-of-action-truth" problems), you have a centralized task-switching, programmatically detectable nexus, you could hook into there for broad-spectrum-suggestion of tasks to jump into
