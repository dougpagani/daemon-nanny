* What I want out of the system
** Runs automatically
- on-startup as daemon
- cron-job [easier to implement]
** No GUI -- fully configured in files
** Multiple types of behavior patterns
- no access after certain time [first target due to ease]
- only a certain amount of time per day
- only a certain amount of time per session
** Flexible Actions taken in response to events
- shut down computer impolitely
- suggest something productive
  - a todo item
  - a daily healthy habit
- shut down computer politely
- notification 
- run any arbitrary script
- play an ugly sound
** Blacklisting vs. Whitelisting
Blacklisting -- just trying to catch the big offenders
- if on a random website chances are it's productive
* V0
- cron-job
- NO GUI 
- No in-memory database -- written to a file
- Behavior Pattern: No access after a certain time
  - every minute poll and record a log of the active window
  - if > X polls for an unproductive use of time in a certain time window, then
    take action
- Action: impolitely shutdown computer 
** script
- data-logging
- condition-action table
  - register condition-action pairs to check against the data log every minute
    - Action is a shell script 
    - Condition is a predicate for the data table
** Examples
- After 10pm, if this data point is something unproductive hard red-shift as the action
** Build
*** TODO Every minute cron-job
*** TODO get active window
*** TODO write to log
*** TODO condition-action table
*** TODO Put it all together
